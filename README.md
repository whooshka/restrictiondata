# Restriction data specification- License
An open standard under CC-BY-SA v.4 for the consistent digital representation of street parking signage restriction data from **anywhere** in the world.
Please refer to the License.txt file for the full terms of the license, or creativecommons.org.

# What it is
This is a json based specification that expresses street-parking restrictions (as found on street parking signs) in a consistent format.  

# Why it matters
Whooshka is making this standard openly available to encourage hackers and civic minded people around the world to build tools that digitises street parking data, as LGAs and Councils often don't have the resources to do it, or maintain it once done.

# What is a restriction "profile"
In congested areas, street parking signages are often a nightmare because they have multiple "profiles".  A profile is basically a restriction that applies at that place, at that precise day, date, and time, and for individuals allowed to park there. A profile could also include prohibitions from parking, standing cars, loading-only zones, etc. The reason this gets very confusing is multiple profiles may crowd a single sign, making it all but incomprehensible.  By standardising the way we digitally store, parse and express this data, we can build tools and functionalities that help local governments manage and plan parking restrictions and also help digital applicatons display only contextually relevant signage data.  This is what Whooshka.me does.
